## HRDA: Context-Aware High-Resolution Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation

## Setup Environment

For this project, we used python 3.8.5. We recommend setting up a new virtual
environment:

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/hrda
source ~/venv/hrda/bin/activate
```

In that environment, the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

Please, download the MiT-B5 ImageNet weights provided by [SegFormer](https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer?tab=readme-ov-file#training)
from their [OneDrive](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xieenze_connect_hku_hk/EvOn3l1WyM5JpnMQFSEO5b8B7vrHw9kDaJGII-3N9KNhrg?e=cpydzZ) and put them in the folder `pretrained/`.
Further, download the checkpoint of [HRDA on GTAâ†’Cityscapes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6n1HearrXHZTHxNRWp8HCMyqbulKcSW/view?usp=sharing) and extract it to the folder `work_dirs/`.
